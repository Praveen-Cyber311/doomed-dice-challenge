Doomed Dice Challenge ðŸŽ²

Overview

The Doomed Dice Challenge is a probability-based game where two dice are rolled, and the sum of their values is analyzed. The challenge involves calculating probabilities and later reconstructing the dice while maintaining the same probability distribution.

This project includes:

A Flask backend to compute dice probabilities and transform doomed dice.

A frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to interact with the API.
Features

âœ… Compute and display the probability of all possible sums when rolling two dice.âœ… Transform the dice under constraints while maintaining original probability distribution.âœ… Interactive frontend with a button to fetch data from Flask API.âœ… REST API implementation for computing probabilities and dice transformation.âœ… Deployed online for easy access.
